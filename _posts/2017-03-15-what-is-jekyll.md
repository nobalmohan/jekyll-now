[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a static blog generator. One among the hundreds of SSG: Static Site Generators out there. A famous one, though.

Let's say you have few pages of raw text and want to convert them into web pages. Jekyll can do that for you. What more? you can install a theme, add a new font, images and numerous plugins to make it a rich website.

Jekyll is not a Content Management System. Every time you run Jekyll, the entire site gets generated into one bundle with all the required assets like fonts, image and style.
There's no backend database or API to connect. Jekyll works best for the landing page, static sites and blogs. Jekyll is not a replacement for CMS.

Your website is built locally or directly deployed from the server when you edit changes directly. Regardless, it requires a basic understanding of template engines, markdown and version control.

GitHub pages offer free hosting for Jekyll sites. This website is built using Jekyll. I will cover more about setting up Jekyll and hosting in this blog post.
