You can start from Bangalore Saturday early morning and finish the trip by Sunday evening. You got a choice between tadipatri and yaganti, covering both will eat up lot of your time on Saturday. If you are not spending too much photographing the monuments, you can cover both places. I skipped tadipatri because I spent lot of time photographing the monuments.
