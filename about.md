Hello,

I am Nobal Mohan, a web developer based out of Bangalore, India.

I have a master degree in Computer Science from VIT University.

Started my career with Cognizant and eventually moved to Startups. In last 6 years, I worked for two startups fulltime and consulting with a bunch of them on a contract basis now.

Mostly, I work with co-founders to build their MVP and product managers to test new ides. Nonetheless, I get excited about new challenges and opportunities. Do reach out to me if you feel we can collaborate.

I also enjoy cycling, backpacking and captured some of my travelogue [here](http://nobal.in/tags/#Travel).
If you like pictures more than words, you will enjoy my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nobalmohan/).
