Hello! My name is Nobal.

Iâ€™m a freelance web developer based in Bangalore, India. I have over 5 years of full-time work experience in front end development and freelancer from August 2016. I have a post graduate degree in Computer Science from VIT University, India.

My past experience includes working full-time as a web developer for Cognizant (CTSH) and two more early stage startups. More details in LinkedIn.

I am an avid cyclist and done multi-day trips in Himalayas, Sri Lanka and South India. If not coding or cycling, I am with my art kit doing watercolor and sketches. Check out my crazy doodles here.

I also write blog posts about my travel and technology here.
