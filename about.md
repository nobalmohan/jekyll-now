Hello,

 Thanks for stopping by. I am a web developer based out of Bangalore, India. I have a master degree in Computer Science and over 6 years of web development experience with corporates and startups. I spend my time building web applications using Angular JS and React JS. Love everything about the web ;)

If not in Bangalore, I am out with my backpack travelling. Check out my [blog](http://nobal.in/tags/#Travel) for more stories.
