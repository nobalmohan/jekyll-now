Hello,

I am a frontend Consultant working with startups around Bangalore and remotely. I have a master degree in Computer Science from VIT university and about 8 years of web development experience.

I have built scalable apps and SEO heavy site with Angular, React and Vue. Migrating from old stack to a Javascript framework and designing scalable architecture is my expertise combined with SEO, AMP and PWA implementation.

I work with co-founders at a very early stage to build their MVP or help teams scaleup and re-design their JS app. I get excited about new challenges and opportunities. Do reach out to me if you feel we can collaborate.

I also enjoy cycling and backpacking. Some of my travelogue can be found [here](http://nobal.in/tags/#Travel). If you like pictures more than words, you will enjoy my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nobalmohan/).
