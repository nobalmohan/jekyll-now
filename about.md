Hello,

I am Nobal Mohan, a web developer and illustrator based out of Bangalore, India.

I have a masters degree in Computer Science from VIT University.

My career started with working for Cognizant and eventually moving to work full time or part time with a bunch of startups.

I have mostly worked with co-founders at a very early stage to build their MVP and scale up their new ideas. Nonetheless, I get excited about new challenges and opportunities. Do reach out to me if you feel we can collaborate.

I also enjoy cycling and backpacking. Some of my travelogue can be found [here](http://nobal.in/tags/#Travel). If you like pictures more than words, you will enjoy my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nobalmohan/).
