Hello,

 Thanks for stopping by. I am a web developer based out of Bangalore, India. I have a master degree in Computer Science and over 7 years of web development experience with corporates and startups. I spend my time helping early stage startups to built their apps in web technologies and contributing to Open Source projects.

I enjoy backpacking and captured some of my travelogue [here](http://nobal.in/tags/#Travel).
