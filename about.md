Hi, I'm Nobal.

A freelance web developer based in Bangalore, India. I have over 6 years of full-time work experience in frontend development and freelancer from August 2016. I have a post graduate degree in Computer Science from VIT University, India.

I am an avid cyclist and have done multi-day trips in Himalayas, Sri Lanka and South India.
If not coding or cycling, I am out with my backpack traveling.[More](http://nobal.in/blog).

I also write blog posts about technology [here](http://nobal.in/blog).
